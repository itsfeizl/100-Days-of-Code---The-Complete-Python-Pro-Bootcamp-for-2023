Musician Fantana says that even though it was fun and a good experience being featured on “Young, Famous and African”, a popular Netflix series, her first few times on set was awkward.

In a recent interview with Graphic Showbiz, the singer, born Francine Nyanko Koffi, who gained attention for her ‘controversial’ role in the Netflix original series said she is gradually improving on her acting skills.

“My experience has been good. It was a little bit awkward at first but I started getting used to the cameras as time went on. Besides, this isn’t the first time I am in front of cameras. Aside from music videos, I have also featured in a documentary titled My Perfect Funeral,” she said.

Known for songs such as “So What”, Don’t Let Me Fail”, “Touch Me”, “No Dulling” and “Rich Girl Anthem”, Fantana debunked widely held perceptions that thriving in the music industry as a female is not an easy task since you need to work harder to match up with the male counterparts.

She, however, asserted that it was easy surviving in the music industry as a female once you find your mojo.

“As a woman, it is easy to survive because there are loads of different things you can do, whether you have your own business, whether you are married, there are just different ways. All that you need is to find your power,” she said in an interview with Graphic Showbiz recently.

At the moment, Fantana is promoting her latest song, “Your Man”.

The Afro-Dancehall tune produced by Streetbeatz talks about Fantana getting any man she wants if she desired it.

For her future plans, Fantana said she was working on her upcoming “Pills and Concoctions” EP which would be released next month.

“Apart from that, I will be releasing another single this month. Additionally, I have offers for movies and TV roles so I am in touch with my management to know the best line of action then we roll with it,” she said.
