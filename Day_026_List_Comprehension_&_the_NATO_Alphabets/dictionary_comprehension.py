# Challenge 1:
# You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called result
# that takes each word in the given sentence and calculates the number of letters in each word.

sentence = "What is the Airspeed Velocity of an Unladen Swallow?"
# Don't change code above ðŸ‘†
# Write your code below:
words_list = sentence.split()
result = {word: len(word) for word in words_list}
# print(result)


# Challenge 2:
# You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called weather_f that
# takes each temperature in degrees Celsius and converts it into degrees Fahrenheit.

weather_c = {
    "Monday": 12,
    "Tuesday": 14,
    "Wednesday": 15,
    "Thursday": 14,
    "Friday": 21,
    "Saturday": 22,
    "Sunday": 24,
}

weather_f = {day: (temp_c * 9/5) + 32 for (day, temp_c) in weather_c.items()}
# print(weather_f)


# Loop over a Pandas DataFrame
